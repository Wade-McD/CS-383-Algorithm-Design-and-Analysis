# Algorithm Design & Analysis (CS 383) - Fall 2024

This repository contains my work from **CS 383: Algorithm Design & Analysis** at Lewis & Clark College, taught by Professor Peter Drake.

## Overview

Throughout this course, I learned essential tools and techniques for solving computational problems efficiently. The focus was on understanding the time and space complexity of algorithms and how to design solutions that scale well with input size.

### Key Topics Covered:
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Formal analysis of time and space efficiency.
- **Data Structures**: Implementing and using arrays, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.
- **Algorithm Design Strategies**:
  - Brute force
  - Divide and conquer
  - Transformation
  - Incremental improvement

  
## Projects & Assignments
- **Team Projects**: 2D Pattern Matching, Gerrymandering Algorithms, Scrabble AI.
- **Individual Assignments**: Bubble Sort, Red-Black Trees, QuickHull, and more.
